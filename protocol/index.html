					<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
					<p>
						The Knowing Protocol offers a common ground for understanding a world created by interconnected agents. 
						It can be used as a framework for sense-making, or as a shared protocol for accurately transfer 
						meaning between humans and machines. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The Protocol defines a Semantic Network which can represent any reality experienced by humans. 
						It differs from previous semantic networks in several ways, most notably in the assumption that 
						any experienced reality is best understood from three domains; <i>physical</i>, <i>semantic</i> 
						and <i>agent-centric</i>, and that it has a method for concepts and ideas to have <i>grounded meanings</i>.
					</p>

					<h5 id="prototype-1">Prototype</h5>
					<p>The Protocol can be summarized in this prototype:</p>
					<ol class="prototype">
						<li><i>Reality</i> is; <b>physical objects with properties</b></li>
						<li>and <b>abstract ideas</b>, </li>
						<li>represented by <b>symbols</b></li>
						<li>that are <b>categorized</b>, </li> 
						<li>can have <b>relations</b>,</li>
						<li>and can <b>interact</b> with each other</li>
						<li>within <b>restrictions</b>, </li>
						<li>interpreted in <b>contexts</b> by <i>agents</i></li>
						<li>having <b>bias and ethics</b>,</li>
						<li>giving them <b>attributes and meaning</b>.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>
						There have been several attempts for creating abstract representation of human knowledge through a 
						semantic network, which is a knowledge base representing semantic relations between concepts in a 
						network useful for solving problems by artificial reasoning.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Some notable examples are CyCorp, Wordnet, Conceptnet and a number of proprietary graphs from Google, 
						Facebook etc. While they all are add value in their own specialized field, neither of them offer an 
						exhausted representation of how interconnected agents creates meaning of a reality comprising both 
						real-world objects and emerging ideas. At best they offer only a single single-dimensional 
						representation of something not really well-specified.
					</p>
					<h4 id="why-do-we-need-this">Why do we need this?</h4>
					<p>
						There are several reasons why we need a single model for representing individual and 
						collective sense-making, accumulate knowledge, and enable transfer information effectively between 
						humans and machines.  
					</p>
					
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Having a shared reference point</i>, so we know what we are talking about. This will help us detect how our ideas relate to each-other
							and how the concepts we are using for describing reality changes not only depending on who is using them, 
							but even in what context we are using them alone. Once we have this reference point, we can focus on real discussions,
							and not only debating how to describe the reality. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Give more people the ability to understand complex problems</i> using  
							powerful Articifial Intelligence based on this shared knowledge of world-, semantic- and agent-centric objects. 
							That kind of AI would be an instrument for creating a better democracy bottom-up rather than having a 
							government using AI for controlling the masses top-down.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Create a new kind of Articifial Intelligence</i> combining Deep Learning and Symbolic Reasoning, 
							addressing challenges of reasoning, hierarchical representations and learning transferring. 
							A huge benefit would be to get traceability of how AI makes decisions and create models the reality.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4 id="a-new-approach">A new approach</h4>
					<p>
						The Knowing Protocol has emerged from a learn-by-prototyping process while creating a conversational 
						interface, and a gradual discovery no available semantic network was really useful. In addition, an 
						ambition to include individual and collective sense-making as an important dimensions in the model, 
						left no option than building a new model from the ground-up and then look for ways to transfer knowledge 
						from other models into this one. The process of creating the model includes extended research in multiple 
						fields, including linguistics, semantics, psychology, as well as paying much attention to how thoughts 
						are formed and used in my own comprehension and sense-making. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The Protocol uses these existing frameworks as starting points,
					</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>PropBank and AMR</li>
						<li>Roget Classification</li>
						<li>Wordnet</li>
						<li>Primary</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The primary take-aways from the Knowing Protocol are:
					</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>Connecting mentioned frameworks in a single model</li>
						<li>Introducing three domains; Physical, Semantic and Agent-centric</li>
						<li>Introducing a method for grounding meaning using semantic frameworks for state, cause-effect, time and storytelling</li>
					</ul>
					<!--
					Connect AMR to domains. lemma and to Roget’s Classifications
					A novel classification system for adjectives and adverbs
					A novel system for semantic representation of time, cause-effect and storytelling
					Separate physical object’s properties from attributes, where the first are measurable and the last are created by an agent in relation to experience and values
					A novel way for representing complex ideas and how they relate to each other 
					A novel way for representing ethical systems and how they affect the representation of reality
					A novel way of categorizing ideas
					A novel way for representing the process of collective sense-making-->

					<h5>Semantic Research</h5>
					<p>
						While there’s an extended research in the semantics-field and we know some parts in this model will be 
						open for critique from different niches in the semantic research, this model has three primary objectives: 
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							It is a single framework covering all aspects of semantic representation, which means there are some 
							compromises and simplifications which might not be necessary in a pure theoretical framework. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Knowing Protocol is designed to be useful for real world applications and not only a theoretical 
							framework.
						</li>
						<li>
							Knowing Protocol takes advantage of being pragmatic and emerged from learn-by-prototyping dynamics. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Problems with Symbolic Ai</h5>
					<p>
						The Protocol permit the use of Symbolic Ai, which is often criticized for:
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Being monotonic</i>, ie it is difficult to change beliefs once they are encoded in a rules engine. 
							Knowing Protocol tries to solve that problem by Semantic Operations, and Layered Networks (se below).
						</li>  
						<li>
							<i>Not having any real mening,</i> ie symbols are not really grounded and it’s difficult to relate them 
							to to other forms of meaning. Knowing Protocol tries to solve that problem the Three Domains and the breakdown 
							of Concepts into States. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Force machines to communicate through natural language</i> although it is probably not optimal for a 
							machine-to-machine communication. The purpose of the Knowing Protocol is to create shared semantic 
							networks both humans and machines can understand and use.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section id="model" class="content">
					<h3 id="domains">The Model</h3>
					<h4>Domains</h4>
					<p>
						In order to create semantic network fully representing human knowledge, on contrast to existing semantic networks, 
						we use three different classes for abstraction of language:
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Physical Domain</i>, holding objects from the physical reality, with measurable properties
						</li>
						<li><i>Semantic Domain</i>, holding objects from the semantic representation of both physical 
							and abstract ideas
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Agent-Centric Domain</i>, holding objects coming from an agent’s experience and 
							sense-making of previous domains
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						In effect we let the model represent an experienced reality rather than an objective one, 
						and we also include the process of collective sense-making as well as methods for representing 
						ethical systems.

					<h4 id="prototype">Prototype</h4>
					<p>
						The protocol specifies how to use a semantic network for describing reality, and it is best summarized in this prototype:
					</p>
					<ol class="prototype">
						<li><i>Reality</i> is; <b>physical objects with properties</b> 
							<article>
								<span class="c c1">Physical</span>
								Our basic understanding of the physical world is it consists of objects with mesurable properties, which may 
								be the result of a physical process.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>and <b>abstract ideas</b>, 
							<article>
								<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>
								Ideas are mental objects or mental states which an agent uses when making sense about phsyical objects or ideas.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>represented by <b>symbols</b> 
							<article>
								<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>
								We create an abstract representation of the language we use when interpreting objects and ideas.  
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>that are <b>categorized</b>,
							<article>
								<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>
								We categorize these symbols so they make more sense to us. For example, we call some of them Nouns, and some of them a Color. 
							</article>
						</li> 
						<li>can have <b>relations</b>, 
							<article>
								<span class="c c1">Physical</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>
								We relate these symbols with each-other to understand cause-effect, .

						</li>
						<li>and can <b>interact</b> with each other
							<article>
								<span class="c c1">Physical</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>
								Both the symbols themselves (semantics), and what the symbols represents (objects), can interact with each-other in different ways. 
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>within <b>restrictions</b>, 
							<article>
								<span class="c c1">Physical</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>
								Interactions between symbols can only happen within given restrictions; physical, social, psyhological, etc.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>interpreted in <b>contexts</b> by <i>agents</i>
							<article>
								<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>
								Whenever a symbol, or groups of symbols, are understood by an agent (human or machine), that's happening within a context, like a conversation, culture, ideology, etc. 
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>having <b>bias and ethics</b>,
							<article>
								<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>
								Agents have bias and an ethical system, which happens when symbols and relations in the model are compared and valued, especially around case-effect and choice.  
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>giving them <b>attributes and meaning</b>.
							<article>
								<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>
								When agents interpret symbols in a sense-making process, based on context, bias and ethics, they give symbols attributes and meaning.  
							</article>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h4>State handling</h4>
					<p>
						In addition to domains, another suggestion is adding states and changes between these states as an 
						important dimension to the model. These changes between states often replace what other frameworks 
						consider as relations between symbols. They also add a dimension of meaning to concepts, previous 
						models don’t have. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The breadk-down of concepts into states. 
					</p>
					<h4>Time, cause and effect</h4>
					<p>
					</p>
					<h4>Storytelling</h4>
					<p>
						A fundamental way of understanding the reality for humans. A way of grounding the knowledge for Ai. 
						Without storytelling knowledge have no real meaning. 
					</p>

					<h3>Symbol Language</h3>
					<p>
						The Knowing Protocol:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							describes how to draw a graph comprising vertices representing symbols of experienced reality, 
							and edges representing relations between these symbols
						</li>
						<li>
							includes a predefined set of actions, which represents how the symbols can interact with each-other
						</li>
						<li>
							includes a predefined set of property-groups, which represents measurable properties on physical objects
						</li>
						<li>
							includes a predefined set of attribute-groups, which represents agent-centric ways of describing 
							the experience of objects and ideas 
						</li>
					</ul>

					
					<h4>Reality is; represented by symbols</h4>
					<p>
						Both physical objects and abstract ideas are represented by a set of symbols which are then connected with 
						other symbols in the semantic graph. 
					</p>


					<h4>Reality is; physical objects with properties</h4>
					<p>
						To make the model clear, we separate the physical world from the experience of being in that world. 
						A way of understanding the physical world is to say it consists of objects with properties. 
						Although both objects and properties must become symbols for any agent to interpret them, object’s 
						properties are a special class in the Knowing Protocol, defined as:
					</p>
					<p class="definition">
						Properties are measurable and might be the result of a physical process.

					<h4>Reality is; abstract ideas</h4>
					<p>
						Abstract ideas are equally important as physical objects in order for agents to understand a shared 
						reality-space. Ideas are defined as:
					</p>
					<p class="definition">
						Mental objects or mental states which an agent uses when making sense about something.
					</p>
					<p>
						Further more, abstract ideas can have the following behaviours:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Almost all ideas are dependent on other ideas, ie we have to assume some things first in order 
							to assume other things. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Sometimes ideas have circular references
						</li>
						<li>
							When dependent on other ideas, these can sometimes change their definition to some degree, 
							using what we call a semantic displacement
						</li>
						<li>
							Just like actions, properties and attributes, an abstract idea can have arguments that are 
							unique for that idea. Arguments are externalized dependencies which can change depending on the 
							context while maintaining the idea’s prototype. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Ideas often have multiple states, where the differences between these states constitutes the 
							idea itself
						</li>
					</ul>
