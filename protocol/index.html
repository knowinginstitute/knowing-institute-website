					<h4>Abstract</h4>
					<p>
						<i>The Knowing Protocol</i> is a <i>semantic network</i> and a <i>blockchain of ideas</i>, which offers an alternative 
						solution for societal problems coming from 
						diversive sense-making processes. Instead of trying to control minds top-down in an effort to 
						create a stable society, it offers
						a way to bootstrap democracy by being a reference point when communicating ideas, 
						and a schema for understaning any reality experienced by humans. This also offers a solution to
						future problems when Articifial Intelligence will outperform human cognitive abilities, 
						giving us transparence and traceability.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>The Semantic Network</i> differs from previous semantic networks attempts in several ways, most notably by
						introducting the domains <i>Sense</i>, <i>Mind</i> and <i>Being</i>, and adding forms for <i>state-handling</i>,
						which gives the way for creating abstract representations of <i>ehtical systems</i>. 
						It also holds the ability to give concepts <i>grounded meanings</i>, which is an important function when
						creating AI-systems understanding human language. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>The Blockchain</i> consists of a primary layer, which holds concepts and ideas agreed upon by all humankind, 
						including shared values and concepts related to human rights. This layer can only change when a two-thirds
						of token-holders agree. Secondary layers can be any science knowledge or ideaology wich doesn't pass the
						way to be included in the primary layer. Third-level layers are outside the distributed ledger, and holds
						any fictional or real human/machine representation which may include unique memories, knowledge, oppinions etc. All layers offers means of tracability. 
					</p>
					<p>The Semantic Network definition can be summarized in this prototype:</p>
					<ol class="prototype">
						<li><i>Reality</i> is; <b>physical objects with properties</b></li>
						<li>and <b>abstract ideas</b>, </li>

						<li>have <b>relations</b>,</li>
						<li>and can <b>interact</b> with each other</li>
						<li>within <b>restrictions</b>, </li>
						<li>interpreted in <b>contexts</b> by <i>agents</i></li>

					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						There have been several attempts for creating abstract representation of human knowledge through a 
						semantic network, which is a knowledge base representing semantic relations between concepts in a 
						network useful for solving problems by artificial reasoning.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Some notable examples are Wordnet, Conceptnet, CyCorp and a number of proprietary graphs from Google, 
						Facebook etc. While they all are add value in their own specialized field, neither of them offer an 
						exhausted representation of how interconnected agents creates meaning of a reality comprising both 
						real-world objects and emerging ideas. At best they offer only a single single-dimensional 
						representation of something not really well-specified.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="why-do-we-need-this">
					<h3>Why do we need this?</h3>
					<p>
						There are several reasons why we need a single model for representing individual and 
						collective sense-making, accumulate knowledge, and enable efficient information transfer between 
						humans and machines.  
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Having a shared reference point</i>, so we know what we are talking about. This will help us detect how our ideas relate to each-other
							and how the concepts we are using for describing reality changes not only depending on who is using them, 
							but even in what context we are using them alone. Once we have this reference point, we can focus on real discussions,
							and not only debating how to describe the reality. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Give more people the ability to understand complex problems</i> using  
							powerful Articifial Intelligence based on this shared knowledge of world-, semantic- and agent-centric objects. 
							That kind of AI would be an instrument for creating a better democracy bottom-up rather than having a 
							government using AI for controlling the masses top-down.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Create a new kind of Articifial Intelligence</i> combining Deep Learning and Symbolic Reasoning, 
							addressing challenges of reasoning, hierarchical representations and learning transferring. 
							A huge benefit would be to get traceability of how AI models the reality and makes decisions which is
							very dificult in pure statistical deep learning models.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="a-new-approach">
					<h3>A new approach</h3>
					<p>
						The Knowing Protocol have a what-works-works approach, which means whatever works in practice might also work in theory. 
						Even if the process of creating the model includes extended research in multiple 
						fields, including linguistics, semantics, psychology and philosophy, 
						it has no ambision taking on a more philosophical or academic approach than necessary. It has emerged from a learn-by-prototyping process
						after finding there were no existing semantic framworks covering the full extent of human
						knowledge including individual and collective sense-making. Given that, it is still a work in progress and will be
						continuesly developed as need for new qualites emerges. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The Protocol uses these existing frameworks as starting points,
					</p> 
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PropBank" target="_blank">PropBank</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roget%27s_Thesaurus" target="_blank">Roget Thesaurus</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">Blockchain</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The primary take-aways from the Knowing Protocol are:
					</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>Connecting mentioned frameworks in a single model</li>
						<li>Introducing <a href="#domains">three domains; Sense, Mind and Being</a></li>
						<li>Introducing a method for grounding meaning using semantic frameworks for <a href="#state-handling">state, cause-effect, time and storytelling</a></li>
						<li>Introducing <a href="#blockchain">blockchain of ideas</a>, including layers, tokens and support for transaction fingerprints</a>
					</ul>
					<!--
					Connect AMR to domains. lemma and to Roget’s Classifications
					A novel classification system for adjectives and adverbs

					<h5>Problems with Symbolic Ai</h5>
					<p>
						The Protocol permit the use of Symbolic Ai, which is often criticized for:
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Being monotonic</i>, ie it is difficult to change beliefs once they are encoded in a rules engine. 
							Knowing Protocol tries to solve that problem by <a href="#operations">Semantic Operations</a>.
						</li>  
						<li>
							<i>Not having any real mening,</i> ie symbols are not really grounded and it’s difficult to relate them 
							to to other forms of meaning. Knowing Protocol tries to solve that problem the <a href="#domains">Three Domains</a> 
							and the breakdown of Concepts into <a href=#"state-handling">States</a>. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Force machines to communicate through natural language</i> although it is probably not optimal for a 
							machine-to-machine communication. The purpose of the Knowing Protocol is to create shared semantic 
							networks both humans and machines can understand and use, so the basis for the procotol is the opposite: 
							<i>it's necessary for any communication describing a human-centric reality to use natural language</i>, including 
							machine-to-machine communication in that domain. 
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>The Model</h2>
					<p>
						The Knowing Protocol describes how to draw a knowledge graph comprising vertices representing semantic symbols 
						and edges representing semantic relations between these symbols.

					<h3>Prototype</h3>
					<p>
						The definition of this semantic network is stated in this prototype: 
						<!--The protocol specifies how to use a semantic network for describing reality, and it is best summarized in this prototype:-->
					</p>
					<ol class="prototype">
						<li><i>Reality</i> is; <b>physical objects with properties</b> 
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c1">Physical</span>-->
								Our basic understanding of the physical world is it consists of objects with mesurable properties, which may 
								be the result of a physical process.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>and <b>abstract ideas</b>, 
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>-->
								Ideas are mental objects or mental states which an agent uses when making sense about phsyical objects or ideas.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>represented by <b>symbols</b> 
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>-->
								We create an abstract representation of the language we use when interpreting objects and ideas.  
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>that are <b>categorized</b>,
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>-->
								We categorize these symbols so they make more sense to us. For example, we call some of them Nouns, and some of them a Color. Or mammuls. 
							</article>
						</li> 
						<li>have <b>relations</b>, 
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c1">Physical</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>-->
								We relate these symbols with each-other for understanding concepts, cause-effect, meaning, etc.

						<li>and can <b>interact</b> with each other
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c1">Physical</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>-->
								Symbols (ie physical objects and ideas) can interact with each-other in different ways.

						</li>
						<li>within <b>restrictions</b>, 
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c1">Physical</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>-->
								Interactions between symbols can only happen within given restrictions; physical, social, psyhological, etc.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>interpreted in <b>contexts</b> by <i>agents</i>
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>-->
								Whenever a symbol, or groups of symbols, are understood by an agent (human or machine), that's happening within a context, like a conversation, culture, ideology, etc. 
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>having <b>bias and ethics</b>,
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>-->
								Agents have bias and an ethical system, which happens when symbols and relations in the model are compared and valued, especially around case-effect and choice.  
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>giving them <b>attributes and meaning</b>.
							<article>
								<!--<span class="c c2">Semantic</span>&nbsp;<span class="c c3">Agent-centric</span>-->
								When agents interpret symbols in a sense-making process, based on context, bias and ethics, they give symbols attributes and meaning.  
							</article>

				<section id="domains">
					<h3>Domains</h3>
					<p>
						All symbols are conceptual, which means they all represents mental objects or mental states used by agents when 
						making sense of their reality. They are then divided into three domains based on how they are used
						in that process; based on how humans experience their reality and where their attention is in that moment. 
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Senses Domain</i> 
							<article>
								Answers the question: <i>What Is</i>? Attention is close to our senses. 
							</article>
							 
						</li>
						<li><i>Mind Domain</i>
							<article>
								Answers the question: <i>What Reveils</i>? Attention is more in our mind. 
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Being Domain</i>
							<article>
								Answers the question: <i>What Ought</i>? Attention is more settled in being. 
							</article>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Another way of naming the domains could be <i>hand-thought-gut</i>.
					</p>
					<h4>Senses Domain</h4>
					<p>
						Semantic symbols and relations in the Senses domain are close to real-world, they often
						represent a physical object or processes with measurable properties. These symbols  
						gerenally don't need reasoning or abstract thinking. 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Symbols in this domain raises from the question: <em>What is?</em></li>
						<li>They are close to what we as humans can experience through senses</li>
						<li>The appear to us when we have our attention outside ourselves.</li>
						<li>Example: <i>This flower is red. Universe is big. Chickens lay eggs</i>. </li> 
					</ul>

					<h4>Mind Domain</h4>
					<p>
						Symbols in the mind domain are more abstract and related to thinking, reasoning, and concepts 
						generated by reflection or a thought process. 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Symbols raises from the question: <em>What Reveils?</em></li>
						<li>They appear to us when our attention to some extent needs to be inside our minds.</li>
						<li>Most of the symbols, relation and categories found in the semantic network are here.</li>
						<li>Example: <i>Some flowers are red. Universe has a lot of undiscovered black holes. Chickens learn to walk before they can fly.</i></li>
						<li>There are subdomains illustrating the complexity of ideas</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Being Domain</h4>
					<p>
						Symbols in the being domain comes from agent-centric processes, how an agent attribute symbols in previous domains, 
						and are related to a preferences, values and ethical system.  
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Symbol raises from the question: <em>What ought?</em></li>
						<li>They appear to us when we have our attention deeper inside ourselves</li>
						<li>They come from our experience and beliefs</li>
						<li>I like red flowers. Universe seams terrifying. I want a chicken for president.</li>
					</ul>

						A complete reference of symbols are found in the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>.

				<section id="state-handling">
					<h3>State handling</h3>
					<p>
						The protocol permits to group symbols into states and then relate this states with each-other for describing <i>Change</i>.
						This is usable in many ways;
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Grounded Meaning</i><br/>
							We can define a concept as the difference between different states, and by that add more ground to it's meaning.
							[Explain Grounded Meaning and agent-centric meaning.]
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Relation to time</i><br/>
							We can connect states to time-stamps and order events after when the occure in any given timeline. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Cause-Effect</i><br/>
							States can capture cause-effect-relations. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Storytelling</i><br/>
							Storytelling is a fundamental way of understanding the reality for humans. It's also a way of grounding the knowledge for Ai. 
							Without storytelling the knowledge dont' have the same meaning. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Ethical System</i><br/>
							We can use states for attaching values in the Being-domain to changes between states, ie an agent can have a preference
							connected to any change, which is the base for an ethical system. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Protocol uses states instead of many relations found in other frameworks.

					<h4>Reality is; abstract ideas</h4>
					<p>
						Abstract ideas are equally important as physical objects in order for agents to understand a shared 
						reality-space. Ideas are defined as:
					</p>
					<p class="definition">
						Mental objects or mental states which an agent uses when making sense about something.
					</p>
					<p>
						Further more, abstract ideas can have the following behaviours:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Almost all ideas are dependent on other ideas, ie we have to assume some things first in order 
							to assume other things. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Sometimes ideas have circular references
						</li>
						<li>
							When dependent on other ideas, these can sometimes change their definition to some degree, 
							using what we call a semantic displacement
						</li>
						<li>
							Just like actions, properties and attributes, an abstract idea can have arguments that are 
							unique for that idea. Arguments are externalized dependencies which can change depending on the 
							context while maintaining the idea’s prototype. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Ideas often have multiple states, where the differences between these states constitutes the 
							idea itself
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Operations</h2>
					<p>
						The Protocole permits a set of semantic network operations which are important for 
						making the graph an agile representation of human knowledge, where concepts sometimes
						change definitions depending on context and ethical systems, and the ability to 
						merge module-based knowledge and concepts into largers sets. 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="layers">
					<h3>Layers</h3>
					<p>
						The Semantic Network han in theory hold unlimited number of layers, where each layer is a set
						of nodes representing specific knowledge or values. These layers can be merged together
						when using to network for performing any external task.  
					</p>
					<p>	
						The Blockchain protocol defines a primary layer holding general knowledge agreed upon by
						most of humankind. Anyone can the define a secondary layer based on a specific scientific
						knowledge or ideology, and load that ontop on the primary layer when for instance 
						performing a task of analysing a text. The result of that task will then ba based on the 
						sum of all layers currently loaded in the semantic network. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Type-3 layers are generally representing fictional or real humans knowledge and values. 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="displacement">
					<h3>Displacement</h3>
					<p>
						Displacement of concepts are an important quality in the semantic network. It describes how 
						a concept can change definition by making a copy of itself and place that copy in a separate
						context, as a way of alter it's definition in a particual use-case.

					<h2>The Blockchain</h2>
					<p>
						The <i>"Blockchain of Ideas"</i> are defined as a distributed ledger system, utulizing
						blockchain technology. 
					</p>
					<h4>Layers</h4>
					<p>
						The Blockchain holds three different types of layers:
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Primary Layer</i> holding concepts and ideas agreed upon by all humankind, 
							including shared values and concepts related to human rights. This layer can only change when a two-thirds
							of token-holders agree
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Secondary Layers</i> holding any science knowledge or ideaology wich doesn't pass the
							way to be included in the primary layer. These layers are created open-source and driven 
							in community-style development. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Type-3 Layers</i> holding knowledge, memories, oppinions, etichal systems 
							connected to fictional or real human/machine representations. These layers lays outside the 
							distributed ledger and can be used as layers in any application. They also lack the
							tracability of transactions. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Tokens</h4>
					<p>
						Blockchain tokens called <i>Knowens</i> are used for voting on changes in the primary layer. 
						Owners of Knowens will be institutions representing different cultures. 
					</p>
					<h4>Fingerprint and traceability</h4>
					<p>
						Every future statement generated by a Artificial Intelligence using the Knowing Protocol, will have 
						a fingerprint which makes it possible to trace what ideas and concept, and what definitions, is has 
						used to come to that conclusions. This will make it possible to counter-act frogery of mind, and control
						by AI top-down. 
					</p>
				</section>


				<section id="implementation" class="new">
					<h2>Implementation</h2>
					<p>
						The implementation of the Knowing Protocol will be orhestered by 
						Knowing Institute in a module-based rapid prototyping style project, including
						the following blocks:

					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Organisation</i>, including:

								<li>Improve the protocol</li>
							</ul>

						<li>
							<i>Technology</i>, including:
							<ul>

								<li>Finish development of wiki-knowing</li>
								<li>Develop fingerprint technology for future transactions based on AI</li>
							</ul>
