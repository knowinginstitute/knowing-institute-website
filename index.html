							The Knowing Protocol is a single exhaustive framework for representing individual and collective sense-making, accumulating knowledge, and enable efficient information transfer between humans and machines based on a distributed graph-ledger technology. &nbsp;
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing Institute protects the protocol and coordinates the continuous growth of content.

						<h3 id="what-is-it-for">
							What is it for?
						</h3>
						<p>
							There are two main reasons for the protocol:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Bootstrap Democracy</li>
							<li>Bootstrap Symbolic AI</li>
						</ul>
						<h4 id="bootstrap-democracy">
							Bootstrap Democracy
						</h4>
						<p>
							Rapid technological development puts a lot of stress on democratic systems. In order for democracy to work, a majority of us must learn how to handle a much greater complexity. Unfortunately, it is going to take some time for educational systems to transform a global society. Even an optimistic prognosis would say it takes at least another 2-3 generations. And it doesn’t take a pessimist to think that might be too late.
						</p>
						<p>
							Traditionally there are two opposite ways to solve the problem with 
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing Protocol is a way of hacking the system. Using Personal Ai would

						<p>
							and analyze complex give more people the ability to familiarize themselves with complex problems by using a kind of distributed Ai, ie that Ai becomes a tool for creating a better democracy upside down rather than creating control upside down, and partly to create traceability in how Ai creates models of reality.
						</p>
						<h4 id="bootstrap-symbolic-ai">
							Bootstrap Symbolic AI
						</h4>
						<p>
							Although promising, there have been some objectives ragarding Symbolic AI.
						</p>
						<h3 id="applications">
							Applications
						</h3>
						<p>
							We think there will be a number of applications in the future. , and we estimate the number of applications will increase in the coming years.
						</p>
						<h5 id="wiki-knowing">
							Wiki Knowing
						</h5>
						<p>
							Knowing Institute is also developing and hosting Wiki Knowing, which let’s you:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Add content to the Knowing Graph in a Wiki-style environment
							</li>
							<li>
								Get access to you own powerful and personal symbolic Ai
							</li>
							<li>
								Analyze any text and find what it really means
							</li>
							<li>
								Create personal and shared Notebooks
							</li>
							<li>
								Create crowd-sourcing campaigns
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5 id="third-party">
							Third Party
						</h5>
						<p>
							Anyone can write applications which will use the Knowing Protocol for making sense of a reality shared by humans and machines. We will add known projects to this list as they grow in number.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Knowing Company develops a conversational AI called Cognizens
							</li>
							<li>
								NewsValue is a tool for finding bias in news
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5 id="third-party">
							Manifest
						</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Future Societies will use AI extensively, but down-up and not top-down 
								<li>
									Human language will be the main communication protocol between human and machines
								</li>
								<li>
									Knowing Protocol will be an important communcation mean between machines, becuase it explicible includes human ideologies and values, which will always be important in a human civilazation
								</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							We are convinced of the need of a common knowledge graph which holds both concepts, ideas and beliefs. And that there will be one dominating one in the near future. If this is the Knowing Protocol or not depends first on how many backers it gets initially. We think it's worth considering, because of it's unique abilities: 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Covering three spaces of physical, semantic and anent-centric space of reality
							</li>
							<li>
								Ability to ground concepts in states and changes
							</li>
							<li>
								Resit manipulation and corruption by using distributed ledger tehnology
							</li>
						</ul>
