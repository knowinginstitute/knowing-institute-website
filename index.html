							Knowing Institute is the protector of the Knowing Protocol
						</h1>
						<div>
							<h3>
								Let’s agree upon what we are talking about.
							</h3>
							Protocol for saving us from ourselves (and from future ai)
						</div>

						<p>
							The Knowing Protocol offers a common ground for understanding a world created by interconnected agents. 
							It can be used as a framework for sense-making, and as a shared protocol for accurately transfer 
							meaning between humans and machines. 
						</p>
						<p>
							It is a single exhaustive framework for representing individual and collective sense-making, 
							accumulating knowledge, based on a distributed graph-ledger technology.
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing Institute protects the protocol and coordinates the continuous growth of content.
						</p>
						<h3 id="what-is-it-for">
							What is it for?
						</h3>
						<p>
							There are two main reasons for the protocol.
						</p>
						<h3 id="bootstrap-democracy">
							> Bootstrap Democracy
						</h3>
						<p>
							Rapid technological development puts a lot of stress on democratic systems. In order for democracy to work, 
							a majority of us must learn how to handle a much greater complexity. Unfortunately, it is going to take some 
							time for educational systems to transform a global society. Even an optimistic prognosis would say it takes at 
							least another 2-3 generations. And it doesn’t take a pessimist to think that might be too late.
						</p>
						<p>
							Traditionally there have been very few suggestions to solve this problem, leaving us with some kind of
							top-down societal power for controlling our minds, either with brute-force, ideology or mabye a strong AI
							in the future. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing Protocol is a way of hacking the system. Using The procofol as a reference for ideas and concept 
							would give us transparence in how different interest groups define problems and solutions. 
							Combining with some kind of Personal Ai, helping anyone to analyze complex information, would 
							give more people the ability to familiarize themselves with complex problems. 
							Combining AI with The Protocol would offer a way of creating a better democracy upside down rather than creating 
							control upside down.
						</p>
						<h3 id="bootstrap-symbolic-ai">
							> Bootstrap Symbolic AI
						</h3>
						<p>
							Once promising, objectives ragarding Symbolic AI has made much resarch abonding it in recent yeas, to focus
							on  Deep Learning's ability to create models representing human knowledge. The Protocol addresses
							these weak spots and offers soulutions. Further more, it stresses the importance of using traceablility and
							natural languge in any application which will have some effect on how humans create meaning of life and society.  
						</p>
						<h3>Applications</h3>
						<p>
							We think there will be a number of use-cases for this technology in the future, and we estimate 
							the number of applications will increase in the coming years.
						</p>
						<h5 id="wiki-knowing">
							Wiki Knowing
						</h5>
						<p>
							Knowing Institute is also developing and hosting Wiki Knowing, which let’s you:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Add content to the Knowing Graph in a Wiki-style environment
							</li>
							<li>
								Get access to you own powerful and personal symbolic Ai
							</li>
							<li>
								Analyze any text and find what it really means
							</li>
							<li>
								Create personal and shared Notebooks. Talk-page for every concept in wiki including notebook
							</li>
							<li>
								Create crowd-sourcing campaigns
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5 id="third-party">
							Third Party
						</h5>
						<p>
							Anyone can write applications which will use the Knowing Protocol for making sense of a reality shared by 
							humans and machines. We will add known projects to this list as they grow in number.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Knowing Company develops a conversational AI called Cognizens
							</li>
							<li>
								NewsValue is a tool for finding bias in news
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Manifest</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Future Societies will use AI extensively, but down-up and not top-down 
								<li>
									Human language will be the main communication protocol between human and machines
								</li>
								<li>
									Knowing Protocol will be an important communcation mean between machines, becuase it explicible 
									includes human ideologies and values, which will always be important in a human civilazation
								</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Proposal</h3>
						<p>
							We are convinced of the need of a common knowledge graph which holds both concepts, ideas and beliefs. 
							And that there will be one dominating one in the near future. If this is the Knowing Protocol or not 
							depends first on how many backers it gets initially. We think it's worth considering, because of it's unique abilities: 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Covering three spaces of senses, mind and being domains in the experience of human reality
							</li>
							<li>
								Ability to ground concepts in states and changes
							</li>
							<li>
								Resist manipulation and corruption by using distributed ledger tehnology
							</li>
						</ul>
