    content: "The Knowing Protocol is a single exhaustive framework for representing individual and collective sense-making, accumulating knowledge, and enable efficient information transfer between humans and machines based on a distributed graph-ledger technology. \_\n\nKnowing Institute protects the protocol and coordinates the continuous growth of content.\n\n### What is it for?\n\nThere are two main areas where the protocol can be used, and we estimate the number of applications will increase tremendously in the coming years.\n\n## Bootstrap Democracy\n\nRapid technological development puts a lot of stress on democratic systems. In order for democracy to work, a majority of us must learn how to handle a much greater complexity. Unfortunately, it is going to take some time for educational systems to transform a global society. Even an optimistic prognosis would say it takes at least another 2-3 generations. And it doesn't take a pessimist to think that might be too late.\n\nKnowing Protocol is a way of hacking the system. Using Personal Ai would\n\nand analyze complex give more people the ability to familiarize themselves with complex problems by using a kind of distributed Ai, ie that Ai becomes a tool for creating a better democracy upside down rather than creating control upside down, and partly to create traceability in how Ai creates models of reality.\n\n## Bootstrap Symbolic AI\n\nAlthough promising, there have been some objectives ragarding Symbolic AI.\n\n### Applications\n\nWe think there will be a number of applications in the future.\n\n##### Wiki Knowing\n\nKnowing Institute is also developing and hosting Wiki Knowing, which let's you:\n\n*   Add content to the Knowing Graph in a Wiki-style environment\n\n*   Get access to you own powerful and personal symbolic AI\n\n*   Analyze any text and find what it really means\n\n*   Create personal and shared Notebooks\n\n*   Create crowd-sourcing campaigns\n\n##### Third Party\n\nAnyone can write applications which will use the Knowing Protocol for making sense of a reality shared by humans and machines. We will add known projects to this list as they grow in number.\n\n*   Knowing Company develops a conversational AI called Cognizens\n\n*   NewsValue is a tool for finding bias in news\n"
